BlocklyPropClient
=======================

# Introduction
The BlocklyPropClient is a vital part of the http://blockly.parallax.com system that must be installed and run locally on the user's computer to complete the connection to the target Propeller microcontroller product. It provides local connection features- downloading your programs into the Propeller-based product and creating a debugging serial connection between it and the BlocklyProp Editor in the web browser.
